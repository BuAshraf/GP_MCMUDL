 # Repository Description:

This repository contains the codebase and resources for our graduation project titled "Melanoma Classification Model Using Deep Learning." Skin cancer, particularly melanoma, is a significant health concern, and early diagnosis is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Our project focuses on developing an efficient and accessible deep-learning model to classify melanoma lesions from clinical images.

# Key Features:

Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.
Utilization of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for melanoma detection.
Evolutionary algorithm-based approach for handling imbalanced datasets.
Comprehensive documentation and resources for training and evaluation.
