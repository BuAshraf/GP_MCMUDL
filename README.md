 # Repository Description:

This repository contains the codebase and resources for our graduation project titled "Melanoma Classification Model Using Deep Learning." Skin cancer, particularly melanoma, is a significant health concern, and early diagnosis is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Our project focuses on developing an efficient and accessible deep-learning model to classify melanoma lesions from clinical images.

## Key Features:

Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.
Utilization of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for melanoma detection.
Evolutionary algorithm-based approach for handling imbalanced datasets.
Comprehensive documentation and resources for training and evaluation.

# How we run the code 

#### 1-	We must download the anaconda from this link
          [1](./GP_MCMUDL/Read ME/1.png)


            https://www.anaconda.com/
#### 2- Download the VScode from this link and install it 
            https://code.visualstudio.com/download
#### 3- Go to the extension part in VScode and download the python and Jupiter extensions

#### 4- Insert the file of code and file of dataset in same folder and open it by VScode

#### 5- To train the model open the melanoma22.ipynb and click in run all button.

#### 6-	To run the gui open folder deploy and chose file gui.py

#### 7- The chose run button in vscode

#### 8- Few seconds and the main screen popped up
